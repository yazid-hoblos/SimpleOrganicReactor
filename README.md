# SimpleOrganicReactor

A simple program that receives reactants (in SMILES format) as input, and outputs their corresponsing products. PubChem is automatically accessed to obtain the IUPAC names and structures. The structures could be saved in the same directory as PNG files. 

The allowed reactions and the setup of the program are displayed below:
